This script extract all the subcellular localization information for a list of human proteins
The localization information is downloaded from https://compartments.jensenlab.org/Downloads

This is used in Yifei's data analysis pipline

```{r}
library(readr)
```

```{r}
# Using read_tsv to read a TSV file
data_file <- "human_compartment_integrated_full.tsv"
data <- read_tsv(data_file)

# Display the first few rows of the data
head(data)
  
# Rename columns for easier reference
colnames(data) <- c( "Protein1", "Protein2", "GO_ID", "Localization", "Value")

# Filter data for the given protein names
protein_list <- c("cntnap1", "potee")  
filtered_data <- data[data$Protein1 %in% protein_list, ]

# Extract localization information
localization_info <- filtered_data[, c("Protein1", "Localization","Value")]
```


```{r}
# Load the readr package
library(readr)

# Function to extract localization information for given protein names
extract_localization <- function(tsv_file, protein_list) {
  # Read the TSV file
  data <- read_tsv(tsv_file, col_names = FALSE)
  
  # Rename columns for easier reference
  colnames(data) <- c("Index", "Protein1", "Protein2", "GO_ID", "Localization", "Value")
  
  # Filter data for the given protein names
  filtered_data <- data[data$Protein1 %in% protein_list, ]
  
  # Extract localization information
  localization_info <- filtered_data[, c("Protein1", "Localization","Value")]
  
  return(localization_info)
}

# Example usage
tsv_file <- "human_compartment_integrated_full.tsv"
protein_list <- c("cntnap1", "potee")  # Replace with your list of protein names

localization_info <- extract_localization(tsv_file, protein_list)
print(localization_info)
```
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
